    <h1>Welcome to the memory card game!</h1>
    <h2>How to play?</h2>
    <p>In order to play, first generate a game with a size you want. Once the game is generated, every card is shown once for the first time.</p>
    <p>After that, all cards are hidden and you can reveal an individual card for 2 seconds by clicking them.</p>
    <p>Every card has a copy. Your goal is to match same cards together by clicking them with the least amount of tries.</p>
